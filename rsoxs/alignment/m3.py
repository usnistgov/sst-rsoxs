    Sweeps M3 pitch across different M3 x, energies, and polarizations.
    If the M3 pitch and x at which the maximum flux occurs stays the same across energies, then upstream M2/PGM are well-aligned.
    If not, then the M2/PGM roll may need to be adjusted via the manual wobble stick.

    TODO: Make a version that uses flymax.

    Args:
        polarizations: list of float values between -1 and 180
            List of polarizations (in degrees) to scan.
            Defaults to [0, 90]
        energies: list of float values between 70 and 2200
            List of energies (eV) to scan.
            Defaults to energies_250grating_default or energies_1200grating_default list to span energies covered by grating.
        m3_xs: list of float values
            List of inboard-outboard positions of M3 mirror.
        m3_pitches: list of float values
            List of M3 rotations about vertical axis.
        configuration: str
            Instrument configuration at which to run the scan.
        sample_id: str
            Sample to load before running the scan.



    Returns:
        Sweep of M3 settings across different beamline settings.


    Raises:


    Examples:
        For user beam time startup and before energy calibration, run a smaller subset such as RE(m3_sweep(polarizations=[0], energies=[270], m3_xs=[24.2]))
        
        For commissioning studies and after energy calibration, run the default parameters using RE(m3_sweep()).
